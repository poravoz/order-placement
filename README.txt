the project is a mini example of ordering an online store
here you can add my orders so that when the request is sent to the database, 
it would appear on the user's site and he could see or cancel his order, 
the back-end part of the deletion is already implemented, but I was too lazy to do it all on the front-end. 
You can also add registration, authentication, for usernames, and, for example, roles, if you have an admin role,
you could add and delete products yourself
